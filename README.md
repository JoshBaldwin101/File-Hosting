# File-Hosting
An uninteresting repository reserved for hosting files and media to be referenced in my other repositories.

I just learned that you can host media on github to be displayed in the README.md of other repositories. Super cool stuff. So this repository is dedicated to that!

# Example usage:

Looks like:
