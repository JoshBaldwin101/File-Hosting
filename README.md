# File-Hosting
A mostly uninteresting repository reserved for hosting files and media to be referenced in my other repositories.

I just learned that you can host media on github to be displayed in the README.md of other repositories. Super cool stuff. So this repository is dedicated to that!

# Example usage:

Using Markdown:
```md
<!-- Example with placeholders -->
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USERNAME/REPO-NAME/BRANCH/FOLDER/SUBFOLDER/FILE.png>
```
```md
<!-- See the photo below -->
<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoshBaldwin101/File-Hosting/main/Images/File-Hosting/dogeduck1.png>
```
Looks like:
